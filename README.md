### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching in strings.  Any pattern that you can define formulaically you can encode into a regex.  This can be anything from a preset string with no variables to something with a particular format, like a phone number or street address.  There are many tricks to learn about regex, so rather then enumerating them here I recommend you check out a few resources:

* [Javascript Regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
* [Regex as a language](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
* [A bit more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

You can even use regex to help edit and reformat strings (with string methods like replace in javascript), although we won’t be discussing that here.

In this repo you’ll find a number of problems that can be solved with regex.  Your goal for each problem is to write a regex that finds a match each string in the "matches" lists, but none of the strings in the “doesntMatch” lists.
